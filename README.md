# Double-click Heart Mini Project
Are you a fan of vintage Volkswagen Beetles? Then put your cursor over the image of my 1963 Gulf Blue, California-original VW Ragtop Beetle and show it some love by double-clicking away!

## Objective
* Use CSS grow animation to grow a heart that will appear when the user double-clicks on the image.
* Use JavaScript to set a double-click event at the exact position clicks occur with client x and client y values and event target offset top and left, as well as to set a counter for the number of clicks.
